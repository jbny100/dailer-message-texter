Resistance is internal - It rises from within. It is self-generated.
Resistance is insidious - It will tell you anything to keep you from doing your work.
Resistance is implacable - It cannot be reasoned with.
Resistance is impersonal - It is a force of nature that acts objectively.

Resistance is universal - Everyone experiences it.
Resistance never sleeps - The battle must be fought anew every day.
Resistance plays for keeps - It aims to kill.
Resistance is fueled by fear - It has no strength of its own. We feed it with power by our fear of it. Master that fear and we conquer resistance.
Resistance only opposes in one direction - It obstructs movement only from a lower sphere to a higher.
Resistance is most powerful at the finish line. Be wary at the end; don't open that bag of wind.
Resistance recruits allies - People notice your success and subconsciously try to sabotage.
This very moment we can change our lives. There never was a moment, and never will be, when we are without the power to alter our destiny.
